# Conway's Game of Life

This project is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway. The game simulates the life cycle of cells on a grid based on a set of rules, offering fascinating patterns that evolve over time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed on your system to run this project. Python 3.x is recommended. You can download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# game_of_life-caron-cdof2
Implementation in Python of the Conway's Game of Life. 


### Installing

Follow these steps to get a development environment running:

1. Open GitBash and clone the GitHub repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/clementcaron/game_of_life-caron-cdof2.git
    ```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

    ```
    cd game-of-life-caron-cdof2
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

End with seeing the Game of Life running in your console.

## Running the tests

This project currently does not include automated tests. Testing is done manually by running the script and observing the behavior of the cellular automaton.

## Deployment

This script can be run locally on your machine. Deployment beyond a local machine (like web deployment) is not supported in the current version.
